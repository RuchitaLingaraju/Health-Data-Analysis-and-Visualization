# 📊 Health Data Analysis and Visualization  

## 📝 Project Overview  
This repository focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques** to analyze key health indicators such as **age, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation**. The objective is to understand health trends, identify potential risks, and provide insights for better health management through statistical analysis and visualizations.  

The project includes:  
- **Categorization of Health Metrics**: Grouping individuals based on age, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen levels.  
- **Distribution Analysis**: Visualizing data spread using histograms and bar charts.  
- **Comparison Across Demographics**: Analyzing health trends based on age and gender.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- **Analyze key health indicators** using visual and statistical methods.  
- **Identify trends and risks** in health parameters like blood pressure and heart rate.  
- **Compare health metrics across different demographic groups** (e.g., age and gender).  
- **Provide insights for preventive healthcare interventions.**

## 📌 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Methods  

### 1️⃣ **Distribution Analysis**  
- Visualizing the distribution of **age, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation** using histograms and bar charts.  
- Helps in understanding the **spread and frequency** of different health parameters.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- Blood pressure levels across individuals.  
- Age group distribution.  

---

### 2️⃣ **Health Risk Categorization**  
- Classifying individuals into groups based on predefined **health risk thresholds**.  
- Helps in identifying individuals with **hypertension, abnormal heart rates, or low oxygen levels**.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- Hypertension categorization (Stage 1, Stage 2, Elevated, Normal).  
- Oxygen saturation risk levels.  

---

### 3️⃣ **Comparative Analysis by Gender**  
- Box plots and count plots to analyze health metrics across different **gender groups**.  
- Identifies differences in **heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation** among male and female participants.  

📌 **Examples:**  
- Blood pressure distribution between genders.  
- Heart rate variability across demographics.  

---

## 📜 Results & Insights  

This project provides:  
- **Insights into common health conditions** such as **hypertension and abnormal heart rates**.  
- **Demographic-based health trends**, highlighting groups at higher risk.  
- **Visual analysis** of health distributions for improved **health awareness and preventive measures**.
