# Health-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing key health metrics, including **age, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation**. The dataset is processed to classify individuals into risk categories, and various visualizations are created to identify trends across different demographics.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Splitting blood pressure readings into systolic and diastolic values.
- **Categorization of Health Metrics:** Age groups, blood pressure levels, heart rate classifications, and oxygen saturation status.
- **Data Visualization:** Histograms and count plots to illustrate health trends.
- **Health Insights:** Identification of hypertension cases, heart rate distribution, and oxygen level patterns.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset includes health-related attributes such as **Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Oxygen Saturation, and Age.**
- Blood pressure values are extracted and categorized into risk levels.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📊 Visualizations
The project includes:
- **Age Group Distribution**
- **Blood Pressure Classification**
- **Heart Rate Trends by Gender**
- **Oxygen Saturation Levels**

## 🔍 Key Findings
- A **significant portion** of individuals exhibited **hypertension** (Stage 1 or 2).
- Middle-aged and senior individuals had **higher blood pressure risks** than younger groups.
- **Oxygen saturation levels** were mostly normal, but some individuals had values **below 94%**, indicating potential respiratory concerns.

## 💡 Future Scope
- **Predictive modeling** for identifying at-risk individuals.
- Incorporating **additional health indicators** like BMI and cholesterol levels.
- Expanding the dataset for **geographical and temporal comparisons**.
